# Assembly Language 
A beginners guide to program in x86 assembly language on linux.

### To Do(s) And Prerequisites
Get familiar with registers.
1. Look at the words/terms used for sizes, like byte, word, dword, qword(qword will only appear in 64-bit assembly which we do not need to worry about at the moment)
2. Read the syscall and syscalls man page in linux.
3. Read about every x86 assembly instruction which you'll encounter in the examples.
4. Get a bit(Setting breakpoints, defining hook-stop, Printing values in registers, etc.) familiar with debugging with gdb.
5. Debugging with gdb will help a lot in understanding what's happening in the registers.
